			background info about me:</p> <p></p> <p class="pt-4">I am deep believer in technology <em>and</em> people. I am deeply curious in nature and I love
			learning and doing. I want to be part of a future that I like and I want to help shape it. I think
			that the world is scary and unpredictable but it doesn&#39;t have to be. I am still looking for my
			place in the world and will probably continue that quest until my demise.</p> <p>I&#39;ve recently started to appreciate reading and have been consuming a ton of amazing books. I
			might have a book section later where I add and sort through some favorites and suggestions.</p> <p>I&#39;ve built this blog to motivate myself to write down my thoughts more and because it was a
			fun challenge. I like the 2000-esque style of making your own unique blog. I&#39;ve built this
			page using SvelteKit and MDsveX (which enabled a nice mix of markdown/svelte writing).
			TailwindCSS is for styling. If you&#39;re interested in reading the source code. It can be found
